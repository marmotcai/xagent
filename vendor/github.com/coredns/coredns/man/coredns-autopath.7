.SH NAME
.PP
\fIautopath\fP - allows for server-side search path completion.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
If it sees a query that matches the first element of the configured search path, \fIautopath\fP will
follow the chain of search path elements and return the first reply that is not NXDOMAIN. On any
failures, the original reply is returned. Because \fIautopath\fP returns a reply for a name that wasn't
the original question it will add a CNAME that points from the original name (with the search path
element in it) to the name of this answer.

.SH SYNTAX
.PP
.RS

.nf
autopath [ZONE...] RESOLV\-CONF

.fi
.RE

.IP \(bu 4
\fBZONES\fP zones \fIautopath\fP should be authoritative for.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBRESOLV-CONF\fP points to a \fB\fCresolv.conf\fR like file or uses a special syntax to point to another
plugin. For instance \fB\fC@kubernetes\fR, will call out to the kubernetes plugin (for each
query) to retrieve the search list it should use.


.PP
If a plugin implements the \fB\fCAutoPather\fR interface then it can be used.

.SH METRICS
.PP
If monitoring is enabled (via the \fIprometheus\fP directive) then the following metric is exported:

.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcoredns_autopath_success_count_total{server}\fR - counter of successfully autopath-ed queries.


.PP
The \fB\fCserver\fR label is explained in the \fImetrics\fP plugin documentation.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.RS

.nf
autopath my\-resolv.conf

.fi
.RE

.PP
Use \fB\fCmy-resolv.conf\fR as the file to get the search path from. This file only needs so have one line:
\fB\fCsearch domain1 domain2 ...\fR

.PP
.RS

.nf
autopath @kubernetes

.fi
.RE

.PP
Use the search path dynamically retrieved from the \fIkubernetes\fP plugin.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.PP
In Kubernetes, \fIautopath\fP is not compatible with pods running from Windows nodes.

.PP
If the server side search ultimately results in a negative answer (e.g. \fB\fCNXDOMAIN\fR), then the client will fruitlessly search all paths manually, thus negating the \fIautopath\fP optimization.
